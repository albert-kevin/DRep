    "comment": "I'm voting YES on setting the Net Change Limit to 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026. Below, I'll briefly explain my reasoning in a way that's easy to understand, balanced, and respectful to everyone involved.\n\nWhy YES?\n\nResponsible Spending: Approving a clear spending limit ensures we only use funds that come into the treasury, avoiding the risk of rapidly draining resources we've carefully built up over time. It's similar to spending only what you earn, which helps keep finances healthy for the long term.\n\nFinancial Stability: This approach keeps our reserves intact, ensuring that we always have resources available to support important and worthwhile projects in the future. It’s like maintaining savings for unexpected or valuable opportunities rather than spending it all at once.\n\nClear Boundaries: Setting explicit limits provides clarity for everyone involved. It makes future budget decisions easier, clearer, and more transparent.\n\nPossible Concerns & Counterpoints\n\nCentralization Concerns: Some are concerned that Intersect or any specific organization might gain too much control over how funds are distributed. This is a fair concern—central control can create inefficiencies or lead to decisions that don't align with the broader community's interests. I acknowledge this worry and share the view that future allocations must remain transparent, decentralized, and closely monitored.\n\nFear of Bureaucracy: There's also a concern about overly complex procedures that might slow down decision-making or reduce transparency. It's important that future processes remain simple, clear, and easy to follow for everyone involved.\n\nBalanced Perspective\n\nThis YES vote doesn't mean automatic trust in any organization; rather, it's a practical first step toward responsible financial management. It sets a sensible boundary for spending, ensuring funds are used thoughtfully and sustainably. Future proposals on specific budget items must still undergo careful review, transparent discussion, and broad community agreement.\n\nTo those voting NO or having doubts: your concerns about centralization, transparency, or spending oversight are valid and important. My YES vote aligns closely with these principles, aiming to protect our treasury and ensure financial responsibility for the benefit of the entire Cardano community."

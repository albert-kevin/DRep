    "comment": "I am voting YES because this single, on-chain budget translates the broad DRep mandate expressed in Ekklesia—more than 70 % of active stake—into an executable plan that remains beneath the 300 M ADA Net Change Limit I already endorsed. By grouping the thirty-nine proposals that cleared the 50 % support threshold and explicitly asked Intersect to act as administrator, we avoid a patchwork of separate withdrawals, reduce deposits that smaller teams cannot afford, and give the community one clear point of oversight. Each project will still face its own due-diligence, milestone, and smart-contract escrow before funds leave the treasury, so low-quality work can be halted without jeopardising the rest. Approving the budget now keeps treasury outflows roughly in line with expected inflows, prevents decision-making gridlock, and lets builders focus on delivering the 2025 roadmap while DReps retain the right to scrutinise every withdrawal. For these reasons, and to maintain momentum under the constitutional process we helped create, I support the Intersect aggregate budget."

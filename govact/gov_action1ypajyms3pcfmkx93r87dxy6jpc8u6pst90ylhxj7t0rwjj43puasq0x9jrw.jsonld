    "comment": "v2.0 is mostly a clean-up plus one meaningful process change. It fixes typos, tightens language, clarifies terms, and removes old, unused parts—so the Constitution is easier to read and use. The full text is here:\nhttps://cardano.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeiezgj4gu6fyxfpnu7h7cgrhfyyvbn4ve72ytpxrv7cmatbok32e4m\n\nWhat actually changes (with simple examples)\n\nTreasury withdrawals get simpler. Before, you had to post a separate “Budget Information” action before asking for funds. Now you can file one Withdrawal action, as long as you include a clear disclosure checklist (what you’re doing, how long it takes, who receives funds, costs, prior treasury withdrawals in the past 24 months, refund conditions, etc.).\nExample: A team asking for 200k ADA doesn’t need an extra budget post; they include those details inside the Withdrawal itself.\n\nSmall asks face less red tape. For under ~1M ADA across two years, some heavier requirements (like audits) are relaxed. Big asks still have stronger controls.\nExample: A 300k ADA tooling grant won’t need the same audit burden as a multi-million ADA program, but large programs still must meet stricter rules.\n\nOld/outdated parts are removed, definitions made clearer. v2.0 trims unused sections (like old DRep/SPO “codes of conduct”) and cleans up defined terms so people use the same words the same way.\nExample: Definitions in the appendices are tightened and aligned with the updated treasury-withdrawal flow, so readers aren’t bouncing between mismatched sections.\n\nWhy I’m voting YES\nThis makes funding faster and clearer for builders while keeping guardrails (disclosure checklist, limits on how much can leave the Treasury). It reduces bureaucracy without removing accountability. Nothing is perfect on the first try, but this is a solid step forward we can iterate on—fix what’s rough in a quick v2.1 if needed, rather than blocking useful improvements today.\n\nConcerns to be aware of (raised by other DReps)\nSome DReps asked for the bigger policy change (removing the Budget Info step) to be voted on separately from all the small edits. Others worry a few rules are hard to enforce in practice (e.g., public disclosure of overlapping roles or compensation when identities can be anonymous), nit-picked inconsistent capitalization (like “Ada Holders”), and questioned the “immutable URL” requirement because a content hash already proves the document didn’t change. I hear these points, and I’m open to a short community “temperature check” to capture feedback for a tidy v2.1 pass.\n\nBottom line\nI’m voting YES because v2.0 cleans up the Constitution and streamlines how we fund work—helping real builders move faster—while we continue polishing details together."

    "comment": "The Cardano Constitution sets a minimum of seven members for the Constitutional Committee, but no maximum, so adding Christina after her close tie with Curia in the snap election fits the rules and boosts resilience—if someone quits, the committee stays above seven and avoids delays in approving actions. Christina adds enthusiasm and fresh ideas, helping users and developers on Cardano, and this follows the permissionless system where anyone can propose changes for more freedom and decentralization. On the downside, with eight members (an even number), decisions need 67% approval, meaning at least six yes votes out of eight; a 4-4 split or close votes could block actions more often, leading to slower governance, and while there's no pay for members now, a bigger group might cost the treasury more later if compensation starts, making it less efficient. Still, I vote yes because the gains in stability and inclusion outweigh the risks."

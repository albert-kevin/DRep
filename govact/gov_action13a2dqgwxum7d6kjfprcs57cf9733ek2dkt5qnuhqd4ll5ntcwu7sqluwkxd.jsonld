    "comment": "I vote YES on the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget because it teams up Cardano's main founders — Input Output Global, Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO — to add needed tools like stablecoins, bridges to other chains, oracles for real-world data and real-world assets projects. Funds go out only after milestones, with audits and reports for transparency, and leftovers return to the treasury in 24 months.\nDownsides: partner names stay secret for deals, cutting early community checks and risking trust if things fail or lean too central, like fiat stablecoins that go against Satoshi's idea of avoiding controlled money and inflation. It hands more cash to big groups like the Foundation, who already hold plenty from early days, instead of using that or funding independent projects that proved themselves, which might slow real decentralization by depending on central players. No full cost details upfront could lead to waste."

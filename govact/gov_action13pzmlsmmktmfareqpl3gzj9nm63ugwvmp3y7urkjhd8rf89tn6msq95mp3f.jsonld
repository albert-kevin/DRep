    "comment": "I'm voting YES on naming the next Cardano hard fork—to Protocol Version 11—the \"van Rossem Hard Fork\" in memory of Max van Rossem. Max was a dedicated Cardano community member who shaped its governance, including pushing for Article VIII in the constitution as a Dutch delegate at the Buenos Aires convention. This article explains how to update the constitution—it sees it as a \"living\" document that can change with new tech or community needs, but only with at least 65% approval from active voting stake (that's ADA holders voting directly or via DReps). This high bar prevents a few people from forcing quick, unfair tweaks or taking control, protecting safety and fair voting for all. Max also led Dutch group efforts for better representation. I met him once at an early constitution meetup; he struck me as smart and deeply passionate about Cardano."

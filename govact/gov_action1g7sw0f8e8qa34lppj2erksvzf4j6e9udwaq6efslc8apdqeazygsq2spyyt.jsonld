    "comment": "I am voting YES because this action simply enacts the results of the May–July 2025 community election and replaces the temporary (interim) Constitutional Committee (CC) with the newly elected CC before the interim term expires; this ensures governance keeps working without a gap for proposals that require CC approval. A YES means the new, community-elected CC takes over with staggered one-year and two-year terms, giving a soft handover that blends fresh members with experienced community councils; I also appreciate that the Cardano Foundation is stepping aside here to strengthen decentralization. Some have noted that only DReps voted in the election, but Cardano’s model is delegated democracy: any ADA holder can become a DRep and vote directly, or delegate their voting power to a DRep and change that delegation at any time. If we vote NO, the interim CC will time out and Cardano could face a governance pause—technical operations continue, but actions needing CC sign-off cannot be approved until a new committee is installed later. For those who want to learn more or take part next time, the official election portal used by DReps is: elections.constitution.gov.tools (with voting run via Ekklesia)."

    "comment": "I’ve reviewed the changes from Cardano Constitution v2.0 to v2.3, as detailed in the IPFS link (https://cardano.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeihjegoita5u67sr6q2cplb33zglytwdo7355u6f2wn4wayhq6uy4e). I’m voting YES because it simplifies governance, speeds up funding for developers and users, and aligns with Cardano’s decentralized vision, building on my support for v2.0. It clarifies terms like “Ada Holders,” defines “Net Change Limit” (the cap on treasury spending), and ensures proposals can’t be changed after submission (ARTICLE II, Section 6), boosting trust. Combining the Budget Info step into a single withdrawal action with a checklist makes funding faster, and requiring audits for all withdrawals ensures community safety, a key priority for me.\n\nHowever, there are risks. The removal of the requirement to name recipients of treasury withdrawals (ARTICLE II, Section 7) could obscure who gets funds, reducing transparency and risking misuse, as noted in other DReps’ concerns about accountability. Not mandating funds for audits in withdrawal proposals might lead to weaker oversight, as audits could be underfunded, potentially allowing sloppy spending. Dropping the Constitutional Committee’s code of conduct mandate (ARTICLE VII, Section 6) means the CC, which approves governance actions, isn’t required to follow clear ethical rules. This could lead to inconsistent decisions, eroding community trust, as some DReps argue it makes the Constitution feel less authoritative. The new “Stake Pool Operator” definition as “the entity controlling cold keys” (ARTICLE II, Section 5) might confuse voting rights in multi-party pool setups, where the keyholder isn’t the main operator, potentially disrupting fair governance."

**Rationale for Voting No on Naming the Next Hardfork "HOSKY"**  
Cardano hardforks should keep a professional naming tradition, not be linked to meme tokens like HOSKY.  
I believe we should follow CIP-59 or future adaptations to ensure clarity and seriousness.  
That's why I'm voting no on this proposal.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on Commitment to Cardano's Vision and Community**  
I'm voting YES as a symbol of appreciation for the visionaries behind Cardano.  
This vote represents my commitment to the community's shared mission of decentralization,  
innovation, and inclusivity.  
Together, we continue to build on the foundation they've laid,  
striving for a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

**Rationale for voting NO on Increasing the k parameter now**  
I believe we should not increase the k parameter right now.  
The network is decentralized, but many pools aren't full, and raising k may not help true decentralization  
since some operators run multiple pools. We need a detailed report before any changes.  
It's important that stake pool operators earn enough to keep the network running,  
especially as demand grows with more dApps. Balancing decentralization and operator sustainability is key.

**Rationale for Voting YES on Naming the Next Hardfork "PLOMIN"**  
In memory of Matthew Plomin to memorialize his actions in life to selflessly support and   
contribute to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and ideas.

**NewConstitution**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on the Cardano Constitution**  
I witnessed and took part in shaping this constitution and watched its approval live from Buenos Aires.  
I understand the hesitation in voting 'yes'—the world is chaotic.  
Like a rocket, we can't change the hardware mid-flight,  
but this is a human starship—we can always improve it.  
The real test is whether big investors and DReps act wisely.  
Let's debate, make tough calls, and set an example.  
The crypto world needs this. Let's make it happen!

**ParameterChange**  
**Rationale for voting NO on lowering the "Treasury Tax"**  
I believe it is too early to change this parameter, as key upgrades like BOS, Leios, and Hydra must first be implemented on the mainnet.  
Additionally, the Cardano project budget should be approved before making any adjustments.  
While I support lower taxation, it is wiser to wait a little longer before implementing changes.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano**  
I am voting YES on the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano because it outlines a well-structured and ambitious plan to enhance scalability, decentralization, and usability.  
The roadmap presents a strong commitment to technical excellence, including advancements such as Leios for improved transaction throughput,  
Hydra and Midgard for L2 scaling, and innovations in programmable assets.  
These developments will strengthen Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain ecosystem by fostering developer engagement, increasing interoperability,  
and driving real-world adoption. The work done by the community, developers, and governance members is commendable,  
and I fully support these improvements to ensure a sustainable and decentralized future for Cardano.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on Setting 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA**  
I'm voting YES to approve a Net Change Limit of 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026.  
This ensures responsible spending by limiting expenditures to match the expected inflows, maintaining financial stability and preserving treasury reserves for the long-term health of Cardano.  
I recognize valid concerns about potential centralization and complex bureaucracy in future budget allocations.  
Voting YES now sets clear financial boundaries without endorsing any particular organization or governance style.  
Future funding proposals should be transparent, decentralized, and carefully monitored.  
My YES vote is a first step towards responsible financial governance, ensuring that resources remain available for meaningful, community-supported projects.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on 2025 Net Change Limit of 350M ADA**  
I agree to set the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 350 million ADA for 2025.  
Enabling treasury withdrawals to fund Cardano’s ecosystem growth without risking depletion.  
  
**gov_action10k0unljvaej0kd89w7pn0zkgdx59c7xkl0x5q78dzvdtd73u0kmqq5xl5y5**  
**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on 2025 Net Change Limit of 200M ADA**  
I vote YES on the 200M ADA Net Change Limit for 2025.  
This cap, well below the annual inflow of approximately 315M ADA, protects the treasury’s reserves of 1.71B ADA,  
aligning with my support for the 300M/250M NCL. Although the 200M ADA does not meet all budget proposals,  
it forces prioritization of high-impact projects, consistent with my vote for 350M to promote disciplined growth.  
The lower limit reduces selling pressure on ADA, addresses Stake Pool Operators concerns after their rejection of the 350M NCL,  
and supports price stability.  
By voting YES, I break the deadlock following the split over the 350M NCL,  
enabling treasury withdrawals before the May 30, 2025, deadline.

**Rationale for voting YES on funding the "Amaru" Rust node**  
I'm voting YES because a second, Rust-based block-producing node adds vital resilience and  
removes the single-implementation risk currently hanging over Cardano. The maintainer committee—Blink Labs,  
dcSpark, Sundae Labs, TxPipe, Cardano Foundation, and Pi Lanningham — has a proven record of shipping high-quality infrastructure,  
so I trust their ability to deliver. The ₳1.5 M ask is bounded to six months, guarded by a smart-contract escrow and  
quarterly public reports; if milestones slip, unused funds flow back to the treasury.  
Rust's efficiency and built-in observability will lower hardware costs for small SPOs and give us better telemetry,  
while encouraging fresh contributors from the wider Rust ecosystem.  
Finally, backing PRAGMA alongside Intersect strengthens collaboration rather than rivalry—diverse teams,  
shared vision, stronger network. Let's fund this pilot, measure its progress, and reassess future budgets based on results.

**Rationale for voting NO on the "Cardano Treasury DeFi Liquidity Budget"**  
I'm voting NO because the plan asks the treasury to sink 50 million ADA into fiat-backed stablecoins without even specifying which ones.  
Today Cardano's native stablecoin market is tiny—about $23 million total and almost all USD-pegged tokens.  
Backing only dollar coins would tether our ecosystem to U.S. monetary policy and concentrate regulatory risk,  
while monthly conversions of ADA to fiat could still pressure the price.  
The scheme returns just 15 % of the yield to the treasury and puts principal at the mercy of smart-contract exploits or a stablecoin de-peg.  
A small, fully on-chain pilot—say 5-10 million ADA,  
multi-currency, milestone-gated, with instant claw-backs—could test the "sovereign-wealth" idea safely.  
Until such a scoped proposal appears, the prudent move is to preserve treasury funds and  
let open-market demand grow stablecoin liquidity organically.  
  
**gov_action1vdlrcftd48qn2zz8egepr6xyfcmxpfz8r69k769gc5mhg662adesq9yy8pl**  
**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA**  
I support this NCL because 300M ADA matches the treasury’s expected inflow for the same 73-epoch window (Epoch 563 – 635),  
keeping withdrawals in line with deposits.  
It gives teams approved for 2025 a clear budget runway into early 2026 while staying below the 350 M cap I previously endorsed,  
preserving reserves for future cycles. A simple, inflation-neutral ceiling maintains fiscal discipline yet  
leaves room for essential infrastructure and governance work—exactly the balance our earlier votes aimed to achieve.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting NO on the 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget – 7.5M ADA for Community Builders**  
I am voting NO because this request duplicates projects that are already scheduled to receive funding in the main 2025 Intersect budget,  
yet appoints Intersect as fund administrator without explicit consent from every team and without a shared framework for milestones,  
reporting, or claw-backs; approving it now would create overlapping custody arrangements, invite double payments,  
and add unnecessary complexity to a governance process that is already spread across GovTool, Ekklesia, and on-chain actions.  
I will support these same initiatives once they are presented through a single, coherent budget or  
as individual InfoActions with clear terms, but until then the prudent choice is to preserve treasury clarity and vote NO.  
  
**gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh**  
**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on the 275 M ADA Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget**  
I am voting YES because this single, on-chain budget translates the broad DRep mandate expressed in Ekklesia—more than 70 % of active stake  
into an executable plan that remains beneath the 300 M ADA Net Change Limit I already endorsed.  
By grouping the thirty-nine proposals that cleared the 50 % support threshold and explicitly asked Intersect to act as administrator,  
we avoid a patchwork of separate withdrawals, reduce deposits that smaller teams cannot afford, and  
give the community one clear point of oversight. Each project will still face its own due-diligence, milestone, and  
smart-contract escrow before funds leave the treasury, so low-quality work can be halted without jeopardising the rest.  
Approving the budget now keeps treasury outflows roughly in line with expected inflows, prevents decision-making gridlock, and  
lets builders focus on delivering the 2025 roadmap while DReps retain the right to scrutinise every withdrawal.  
For these reasons, and to maintain momentum under the constitutional process we helped create,  
I support the Intersect aggregate budget.

**New committee**  
**Rationale for voting YES on “Replace Interim Constitutional Committee”**  
I am voting YES because this action simply enacts the results of the May–July 2025 community election and replaces the temporary (interim) Constitutional Committee (CC) with the newly elected CC before the interim term expires; this ensures governance keeps working without a gap for proposals that require CC approval. A YES means the new, community-elected CC takes over with staggered one-year and two-year terms, giving a soft handover that blends fresh members with experienced community councils; I also appreciate that the Cardano Foundation is stepping aside here to strengthen decentralization. Some have noted that only DReps voted in the election, but Cardano’s model is delegated democracy: any ADA holder can become a DRep and vote directly, or delegate their voting power to a DRep and change that delegation at any time. If we vote NO, the interim CC will time out and Cardano could face a governance pause—technical operations continue, but actions needing CC sign-off cannot be approved until a new committee is installed later. For those who want to learn more or take part next time, the official election portal used by DReps is: elections.constitution.gov.tools (with voting run via Ekklesia).

**Treasury withdrawals**  
**Rationale for voting NO on Cardano Global Listing Expansion – Powered by Snek**  
I’m voting NO. SNEK has real momentum and has already paid for big listings itself, but using 5M ADA from the Cardano Treasury to list and market one token isn’t a public-good expense. It sets a precedent for project-specific listing fees, shifts focus off on-chain growth (CEX trading doesn’t require the Cardano network), and diverts funds from things that help everyone—developer tools, ADA/stablecoin liquidity, compliance frameworks any token can reuse, UX, and core upgrades. We’ll get better long-term onboarding from ecosystem work like BOS, Midnight, and later Leios—tech alone isn’t enough, but public money should build foundations, not promote a single ticker. For marketing-style asks, Project Catalyst is the better venue where the whole community (not just DReps) reviews and votes.

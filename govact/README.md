**Rationale for Voting No on Naming the Next Hardfork "HOSKY"**
Cardano hardforks should keep a professional naming tradition, not be linked to meme tokens like HOSKY.
I believe we should follow CIP-59 or future adaptations to ensure clarity and seriousness.
That’s why I’m voting no on this proposal.

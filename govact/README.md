**Rationale for Voting No on Naming the Next Hardfork "HOSKY"**  
Cardano hardforks should keep a professional naming tradition, not be linked to meme tokens like HOSKY.  
I believe we should follow CIP-59 or future adaptations to ensure clarity and seriousness.  
That's why I'm voting no on this proposal.

**Rationale for voting YES on Commitment to Cardano's Vision and Community**  
I'm voting YES as a symbol of appreciation for the visionaries behind Cardano.  
This vote represents my commitment to the community's shared mission of decentralization,  
innovation, and inclusivity.  
Together, we continue to build on the foundation they've laid,  
striving for a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

**Rationale for voting NO on Increasing the k parameter now**  
I believe we should not increase the k parameter right now.  
The network is decentralized, but many pools aren't full, and raising k may not help true decentralization  
since some operators run multiple pools. We need a detailed report before any changes.  
It's important that stake pool operators earn enough to keep the network running,  
especially as demand grows with more dApps. Balancing decentralization and operator sustainability is key.

contribute to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and ideas.

**NewConstitution**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on the Cardano Constitution**  
I witnessed and took part in shaping this constitution and watched its approval live from Buenos Aires.  
I understand the hesitation in voting 'yes'—the world is chaotic.  
Like a rocket, we can't change the hardware mid-flight,  
but this is a human starship—we can always improve it.  
The real test is whether big investors and DReps act wisely.  
Let's debate, make tough calls, and set an example.  
The crypto world needs this. Let's make it happen!

**ParameterChange**  
**Rationale for voting NO on lowering the "Treasury Tax"**  
I believe it is too early to change this parameter, as key upgrades like BOS, Leios, and Hydra must first be implemented on the mainnet.  
Additionally, the Cardano project budget should be approved before making any adjustments.  
While I support lower taxation, it is wiser to wait a little longer before implementing changes.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano**  
I am voting YES on the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano because it outlines a well-structured and ambitious plan to enhance scalability, decentralization, and usability.  
The roadmap presents a strong commitment to technical excellence, including advancements such as Leios for improved transaction throughput,  
Hydra and Midgard for L2 scaling, and innovations in programmable assets.  
These developments will strengthen Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain ecosystem by fostering developer engagement, increasing interoperability,  
and driving real-world adoption. The work done by the community, developers, and governance members is commendable,  
and I fully support these improvements to ensure a sustainable and decentralized future for Cardano.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on Setting 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA**  
I'm voting YES to approve a Net Change Limit of 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026.  
This ensures responsible spending by limiting expenditures to match the expected inflows, maintaining financial stability and preserving treasury reserves for the long-term health of Cardano.  
I recognize valid concerns about potential centralization and complex bureaucracy in future budget allocations.  
Voting YES now sets clear financial boundaries without endorsing any particular organization or governance style.  
Future funding proposals should be transparent, decentralized, and carefully monitored.  
My YES vote is a first step towards responsible financial governance, ensuring that resources remain available for meaningful, community-supported projects.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on 2025 Net Change Limit of 350M ADA**  
I agree to set the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 350 million ADA for 2025.  
Enabling treasury withdrawals to fund Cardano’s ecosystem growth without risking depletion.  
  
**gov_action10k0unljvaej0kd89w7pn0zkgdx59c7xkl0x5q78dzvdtd73u0kmqq5xl5y5**  
**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on 2025 Net Change Limit of 200M ADA**  
I vote YES on the 200M ADA Net Change Limit for 2025.  
This cap, well below the annual inflow of approximately 315M ADA, protects the treasury’s reserves of 1.71B ADA,  
aligning with my support for the 300M/250M NCL. Although the 200M ADA does not meet all budget proposals,  
it forces prioritization of high-impact projects, consistent with my vote for 350M to promote disciplined growth.  
The lower limit reduces selling pressure on ADA, addresses Stake Pool Operators concerns after their rejection of the 350M NCL,  
and supports price stability.  
By voting YES, I break the deadlock following the split over the 350M NCL,  
enabling treasury withdrawals before the May 30, 2025, deadline.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on funding the "Amaru" Rust node**  
I'm voting YES because a second, Rust-based block-producing node adds vital resilience and  
removes the single-implementation risk currently hanging over Cardano. The maintainer committee—Blink Labs,  
dcSpark, Sundae Labs, TxPipe, Cardano Foundation, and Pi Lanningham — has a proven record of shipping high-quality infrastructure,  
so I trust their ability to deliver. The ₳1.5 M ask is bounded to six months, guarded by a smart-contract escrow and  
quarterly public reports; if milestones slip, unused funds flow back to the treasury.  
Rust's efficiency and built-in observability will lower hardware costs for small SPOs and give us better telemetry,  
while encouraging fresh contributors from the wider Rust ecosystem.  
Finally, backing PRAGMA alongside Intersect strengthens collaboration rather than rivalry—diverse teams,  
shared vision, stronger network. Let's fund this pilot, measure its progress, and reassess future budgets based on results.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting NO on the "Cardano Treasury DeFi Liquidity Budget"**  
I'm voting NO because the plan asks the treasury to sink 50 million ADA into fiat-backed stablecoins without even specifying which ones.  
Today Cardano's native stablecoin market is tiny—about $23 million total and almost all USD-pegged tokens.  
Backing only dollar coins would tether our ecosystem to U.S. monetary policy and concentrate regulatory risk,  
while monthly conversions of ADA to fiat could still pressure the price.  
The scheme returns just 15 % of the yield to the treasury and puts principal at the mercy of smart-contract exploits or a stablecoin de-peg.  
A small, fully on-chain pilot—say 5-10 million ADA,  
multi-currency, milestone-gated, with instant claw-backs—could test the "sovereign-wealth" idea safely.  
Until such a scoped proposal appears, the prudent move is to preserve treasury funds and  
let open-market demand grow stablecoin liquidity organically.  
  
**gov_action1vdlrcftd48qn2zz8egepr6xyfcmxpfz8r69k769gc5mhg662adesq9yy8pl**  
**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA**  
I support this NCL because 300M ADA matches the treasury’s expected inflow for the same 73-epoch window (Epoch 563 – 635),  
keeping withdrawals in line with deposits.  
It gives teams approved for 2025 a clear budget runway into early 2026 while staying below the 350 M cap I previously endorsed,  
preserving reserves for future cycles. A simple, inflation-neutral ceiling maintains fiscal discipline yet  
leaves room for essential infrastructure and governance work—exactly the balance our earlier votes aimed to achieve.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting NO on the 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget – 7.5M ADA for Community Builders**  
I am voting NO because this request duplicates projects that are already scheduled to receive funding in the main 2025 Intersect budget,  
yet appoints Intersect as fund administrator without explicit consent from every team and without a shared framework for milestones,  
reporting, or claw-backs; approving it now would create overlapping custody arrangements, invite double payments,  
and add unnecessary complexity to a governance process that is already spread across GovTool, Ekklesia, and on-chain actions.  
I will support these same initiatives once they are presented through a single, coherent budget or  
as individual InfoActions with clear terms, but until then the prudent choice is to preserve treasury clarity and vote NO.  
  
**gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh**  
**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on the 275 M ADA Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget**  
I am voting YES because this single, on-chain budget translates the broad DRep mandate expressed in Ekklesia—more than 70 % of active stake  
into an executable plan that remains beneath the 300 M ADA Net Change Limit I already endorsed.  
By grouping the thirty-nine proposals that cleared the 50 % support threshold and explicitly asked Intersect to act as administrator,  
we avoid a patchwork of separate withdrawals, reduce deposits that smaller teams cannot afford, and  
give the community one clear point of oversight. Each project will still face its own due-diligence, milestone, and  
smart-contract escrow before funds leave the treasury, so low-quality work can be halted without jeopardising the rest.  
Approving the budget now keeps treasury outflows roughly in line with expected inflows, prevents decision-making gridlock, and  
lets builders focus on delivering the 2025 roadmap while DReps retain the right to scrutinise every withdrawal.  
For these reasons, and to maintain momentum under the constitutional process we helped create,  
I support the Intersect aggregate budget.

**New committee**  
**Rationale for voting YES on “Replace Interim Constitutional Committee”**  
I am voting YES because this action simply enacts the results of the May–July 2025 community election and replaces the temporary (interim) Constitutional Committee (CC) with the newly elected CC before the interim term expires; this ensures governance keeps working without a gap for proposals that require CC approval. A YES means the new, community-elected CC takes over with staggered one-year and two-year terms, giving a soft handover that blends fresh members with experienced community councils; I also appreciate that the Cardano Foundation is stepping aside here to strengthen decentralization. Some have noted that only DReps voted in the election, but Cardano’s model is delegated democracy: any ADA holder can become a DRep and vote directly, or delegate their voting power to a DRep and change that delegation at any time. If we vote NO, the interim CC will time out and Cardano could face a governance pause—technical operations continue, but actions needing CC sign-off cannot be approved until a new committee is installed later. For those who want to learn more or take part next time, the official election portal used by DReps is: elections.constitution.gov.tools (with voting run via Ekklesia).

**Treasury withdrawals**  
**Rationale for voting NO on Cardano Global Listing Expansion – Powered by Snek**  
I’m voting NO. SNEK has real momentum and has already paid for big listings itself, but using 5M ADA from the Cardano Treasury to list and market one token isn’t a public-good expense. It sets a precedent for project-specific listing fees, shifts focus off on-chain growth (CEX trading doesn’t require the Cardano network), and diverts funds from things that help everyone—developer tools, ADA/stablecoin liquidity, compliance frameworks any token can reuse, UX, and core upgrades. We’ll get better long-term onboarding from ecosystem work like BOS, Midnight, and later Leios—tech alone isn’t enough, but public money should build foundations, not promote a single ticker. For marketing-style asks, Project Catalyst is the better venue where the whole community (not just DReps) reviews and votes.
  
Side note for newcomers: if you enjoy the culture, check out Snek and its playful cousin Snok, plus NikePig—they’re part of Cardano’s meme “family” and fun to follow.

**New constitution**  
**Rationale for voting YES on cardano blockchain ecosystem constitution v2.0**  
v2.0 is mostly a clean-up plus one meaningful process change. It fixes typos, tightens language, clarifies terms, and removes old, unused parts—so the Constitution is easier to read and use. The full text is here:
https://cardano.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeiezgj4gu6fyxfpnu7h7cgrhfyyvbn4ve72ytpxrv7cmatbok32e4m  
  
What actually changes (with simple examples)  
  
Treasury withdrawals get simpler. Before, you had to post a separate “Budget Information” action before asking for funds. Now you can file one Withdrawal action, as long as you include a clear disclosure checklist (what you’re doing, how long it takes, who receives funds, costs, prior treasury withdrawals in the past 24 months, refund conditions, etc.).
Example: A team asking for 200k ADA doesn’t need an extra budget post; they include those details inside the Withdrawal itself.  
  
Small asks face less red tape. For under ~1M ADA across two years, some heavier requirements (like audits) are relaxed. Big asks still have stronger controls.
Example: A 300k ADA tooling grant won’t need the same audit burden as a multi-million ADA program, but large programs still must meet stricter rules.  
  
Old/outdated parts are removed, definitions made clearer. v2.0 trims unused sections (like old DRep/SPO “codes of conduct”) and cleans up defined terms so people use the same words the same way.
Example: Definitions in the appendices are tightened and aligned with the updated treasury-withdrawal flow, so readers aren’t bouncing between mismatched sections.  
  
Why I’m voting YES  
This makes funding faster and clearer for builders while keeping guardrails (disclosure checklist, limits on how much can leave the Treasury). It reduces bureaucracy without removing accountability. Nothing is perfect on the first try, but this is a solid step forward we can iterate on—fix what’s rough in a quick v2.1 if needed, rather than blocking useful improvements today.  
  
Concerns to be aware of (raised by other DReps)  
Some DReps asked for the bigger policy change (removing the Budget Info step) to be voted on separately from all the small edits. Others worry a few rules are hard to enforce in practice (e.g., public disclosure of overlapping roles or compensation when identities can be anonymous), nit-picked inconsistent capitalization (like “Ada Holders”), and questioned the “immutable URL” requirement because a content hash already proves the document didn’t change. I hear these points, and I’m open to a short community “temperature check” to capture feedback for a tidy v2.1 pass.  
  
Bottom line  
I’m voting YES because v2.0 cleans up the Constitution and streamlines how we fund work—helping real builders move faster—while we continue polishing details together.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for Voting No on Treasury Stablecoin Liquidity Fund**  
Cardano treasury funds should be used for development, infrastructure, and public goods, not for converting ADA into fiat-backed stablecoins.  
I prefer peer-to-peer trade in ADA itself, this directs value away into USD-based assets alone.  
If the community wants experiments with stablecoin liquidity, they should be proposed through Catalyst or voluntary initiatives, not with 50 million ADA from the treasury.  
Cardano represents more than money alone: RWA, NFTs, smart and financial contracts, BOS integration, and scaling are all stronger reasons for treasury investment.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for Voting NO on "Cardano Global Listing Expansion – SNEK Loan"**  
I’m voting NO. Even as a loan, using 5M ADA of public funds to list and market a single meme token isn’t a treasury mandate or a public good. It sets a precedent that the treasury bankrolls project-specific CEX fees and market-making while the actual activity happens off-chain and doesn’t require Cardano.
I respect SNEK’s hustle and culture—memes are fun, treasuries are serious. If this makes sense, fund it via private capital, sponsors, or Project Catalyst where marketing-style proposals belong. A 2.44% APR near staking yield doesn’t compensate the risk of default, enforcement, and reputational downside if a meme cycle turns.
I prefer treasury spending on foundations that benefit everyone (dev tooling, infra, UX, compliance frameworks, BOS/L2s, core upgrades), not promoting a single ticker. Enjoy the memes on the timeline; I won’t underwrite them with public ADA.

**Rationale for Voting NO on "Cardano in Oceania 2025–2026 Strategy & Budget"**  
I’m voting NO. Regional adoption and marketing programs are better piloted via Project Catalyst and local co-funding, not the main Treasury.  
The plan concentrates spend on soft outputs (events, promotion, meetups) with weak guarantees they convert into durable, on-chain usage.  
It also introduces an external administrator layer and prioritizes one geography with funds that should build global,  
reusable public goods (dev tooling, infra, wallets, standards).

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on "Defining the Cardano 2030 Vision & Strategy"**  
I am voting YES on the Cardano 2030 Vision & Strategy because I believe our ecosystem needs a guiding framework now, even if it is imperfect. The document provides ambition, direction, and a shared “North Star,” which is better than moving forward with no vision at all. At the same time, I recognize the validity of many concerns: the lack of explicit mapping between vision and strategy, the vagueness around key technologies like Leios or Hydra, the absence of privacy and governance details, and the risks of aspirational KPIs without clear execution plans.  
  
My support is therefore conditional in spirit: I see this as a provisional strategy that must be improved. Going forward, I expect stronger commitments to disruptive citizen-empowering projects, better documentation and education, transparent funding oversight, concrete adoption of ADA as currency, and measurable delivery in regions like Africa. I also believe governance and treasury KPIs should be added to ensure accountability.

**NewConstitution**  
**Rationale for voting YES on "CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.3"**  
I’ve reviewed the changes from Cardano Constitution v2.0 to v2.3, as detailed in the IPFS link (https://cardano.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeihjegoita5u67sr6q2cplb33zglytwdo7355u6f2wn4wayhq6uy4e). I’m voting YES because it simplifies governance, speeds up funding for developers and users, and aligns with Cardano’s decentralized vision, building on my support for v2.0. It clarifies terms like “Ada Holders,” defines “Net Change Limit” (the cap on treasury spending), and ensures proposals can’t be changed after submission (ARTICLE II, Section 6), boosting trust. Combining the Budget Info step into a single withdrawal action with a checklist makes funding faster, and requiring audits for all withdrawals ensures community safety, a key priority for me.  
  
However, there are risks. The removal of the requirement to name recipients of treasury withdrawals (ARTICLE II, Section 7) could obscure who gets funds, reducing transparency and risking misuse, as noted in other DReps’ concerns about accountability. Not mandating funds for audits in withdrawal proposals might lead to weaker oversight, as audits could be underfunded, potentially allowing sloppy spending. Dropping the Constitutional Committee’s code of conduct mandate (ARTICLE VII, Section 6) means the CC, which approves governance actions, isn’t required to follow clear ethical rules. This could lead to inconsistent decisions, eroding community trust, as some DReps argue it makes the Constitution feel less authoritative. The new “Stake Pool Operator” definition as “the entity controlling cold keys” (ARTICLE II, Section 5) might confuse voting rights in multi-party pool setups, where the keyholder isn’t the main operator, potentially disrupting fair governance.

**Rationale for voting NO on "Securing Generic Top-Level Domains for the Cardano Ecosystem"**  
I vote NO on the governance action for .ada and .cardano gTLDs. I prioritize proposals that solve real problems for Cardano’s users and developers, like Python’s practical tools drove its growth. This is an expensive branding effort with no clear use case, such as wallet or DApp integration, to boost users or developers. The costs, potentially $2 million per year, are high for unproven impact. Although the Cardano Foundation (CF) uses its own funds, these were once community assets, and their occasionally obstructive stance conflicts with Cardano’s decentralized, community-driven vision. Transparency is promised but doesn’t deliver tangible benefits. Pros: A gTLD could increase Cardano’s visibility and potentially spark Web3 innovation, like .xyz or .crypto. Cons: Without a concrete application, this is a symbolic investment with little measurable impact. The CF’s control over domain sales could centralize power, letting them profit or favor certain projects without strong community oversight, undermining decentralization. I only support projects with proven, community-driven value.

**Rationale for voting YES on "2025 Net Change Limit Extension"**  
I vote YES on the "2025 Net Change Limit Extension" because it keeps Cardano's treasury operations running smoothly without raising the 350M ADA spending cap. It avoids a governance freeze after Epoch 604, allowing key proposals like the 70M ADA Cardano Critical Integrations Budget (for upgrades in scalability and security) to execute on time, benefiting users who rely on these features. Other DReps highlight this continuity as a main reason for yes, and the official explanation at https://github.com/Tingvard-cc/public-records/tree/main/ncl-clarity confirms it adds no new spending but extends the term to Epoch 612 to sidestep constitutional issues.

**InfoAction**  
**Rationale for voting YES on "Cardano Critical Integrations Budget"**  
I vote YES on the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget because it teams up Cardano's main founders — Input Output Global, Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO — to add needed tools like stablecoins, bridges to other chains, oracles for real-world data and real-world assets projects. Funds go out only after milestones, with audits and reports for transparency, and leftovers return to the treasury in 24 months.
Downsides: partner names stay secret for deals, cutting early community checks and risking trust if things fail or lean too central, like fiat stablecoins that go against Satoshi's idea of avoiding controlled money and inflation. It hands more cash to big groups like the Foundation, who already hold plenty from early days, instead of using that or funding independent projects that proved themselves, which might slow real decentralization by depending on central players. No full cost details upfront could lead to waste.

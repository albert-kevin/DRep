**Rationale for Voting No on Naming the Next Hardfork "HOSKY"**  
Cardano hardforks should keep a professional naming tradition, not be linked to meme tokens like HOSKY.  
I believe we should follow CIP-59 or future adaptations to ensure clarity and seriousness.  
That's why I'm voting no on this proposal.

**Rationale for voting YES on Commitment to Cardano's Vision and Community**  
I'm voting YES as a symbol of appreciation for the visionaries behind Cardano.  
This vote represents my commitment to the community's shared mission of decentralization,  
innovation, and inclusivity.  
Together, we continue to build on the foundation they've laid,  
striving for a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

**Rationale for voting NO on Increasing the k parameter now**  
I believe we should not increase the k parameter right now.  
The network is decentralized, but many pools aren't full, and raising k may not help true decentralization  
since some operators run multiple pools. We need a detailed report before any changes.  
It's important that stake pool operators earn enough to keep the network running,  
especially as demand grows with more dApps. Balancing decentralization and operator sustainability is key.

**Rationale for Voting YES on Naming the Next Hardfork "PLOMIN"**  
In memory of Matthew Plomin to memorialize his actions in life to selflessly support and   
contribute to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and ideas.

**NewConstitution**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on the Cardano Constitution**  
I witnessed and took part in shaping this constitution and watched its approval live from Buenos Aires.  
I understand the hesitation in voting 'yes'—the world is chaotic.  
Like a rocket, we can't change the hardware mid-flight,  
but this is a human starship—we can always improve it.  
The real test is whether big investors and DReps act wisely.  
Let's debate, make tough calls, and set an example.  
The crypto world needs this. Let's make it happen!

**ParameterChange**  
**Rationale for voting NO on lowering the "Treasury Tax"**  
I believe it is too early to change this parameter, as key upgrades like BOS, Leios, and Hydra must first be implemented on the mainnet.  
Additionally, the Cardano project budget should be approved before making any adjustments.  
While I support lower taxation, it is wiser to wait a little longer before implementing changes.

**Rationale for Voting YES on the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano**  
I am voting YES on the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano because it outlines a well-structured and ambitious plan to enhance scalability, decentralization, and usability.  
The roadmap presents a strong commitment to technical excellence, including advancements such as Leios for improved transaction throughput,  
Hydra and Midgard for L2 scaling, and innovations in programmable assets.  
These developments will strengthen Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain ecosystem by fostering developer engagement, increasing interoperability,  
and driving real-world adoption. The work done by the community, developers, and governance members is commendable,  
and I fully support these improvements to ensure a sustainable and decentralized future for Cardano.

**Rationale for voting YES on Setting 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA**  
I'm voting YES to approve a Net Change Limit of 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026.  
This ensures responsible spending by limiting expenditures to match the expected inflows, maintaining financial stability and preserving treasury reserves for the long-term health of Cardano.  
I recognize valid concerns about potential centralization and complex bureaucracy in future budget allocations.  
Voting YES now sets clear financial boundaries without endorsing any particular organization or governance style.  
Future funding proposals should be transparent, decentralized, and carefully monitored.  
My YES vote is a first step towards responsible financial governance, ensuring that resources remain available for meaningful, community-supported projects.

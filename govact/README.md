**Rationale for Voting No on Naming the Next Hardfork "HOSKY"**  
Cardano hardforks should keep a professional naming tradition, not be linked to meme tokens like HOSKY.  
I believe we should follow CIP-59 or future adaptations to ensure clarity and seriousness.  
That's why I'm voting no on this proposal.

**Rationale for voting YES on Commitment to Cardano's Vision and Community**  
I'm voting YES as a symbol of appreciation for the visionaries behind Cardano.  
This vote represents my commitment to the community's shared mission of decentralization,  
innovation, and inclusivity.  
Together, we continue to build on the foundation they've laid,  
striving for a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

**Rationale for voting NO on Increasing the k parameter now**  
I believe we should not increase the k parameter right now.  
The network is decentralized, but many pools aren't full, and raising k may not help true decentralization  
since some operators run multiple pools. We need a detailed report before any changes.  
It's important that stake pool operators earn enough to keep the network running,  
especially as demand grows with more dApps. Balancing decentralization and operator sustainability is key.

**Rationale for Voting YES on Naming the Next Hardfork "PLOMIN"**  
In memory of Matthew Plomin to memorialize his actions in life to selflessly support and   
contribute to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and ideas.

**NewConstitution**  
**Rationale for Voting YES on the Cardano Constitution**  
I witnessed and took part in shaping this constitution and watched its approval live from Buenos Aires.  
I understand the hesitation in voting 'yes'—the world is chaotic.  
Like a rocket, we can't change the hardware mid-flight,  
but this is a human starship—we can always improve it.  
The real test is whether big investors and DReps act wisely.  
Let's debate, make tough calls, and set an example.  
The crypto world needs this. Let's make it happen!

    "comment": "I vote YES on the 200M ADA Net Change Limit for 2025. This cap, well below the annual inflow of approximately 315M ADA, protects the treasury’s reserves of 1.71B ADA, aligning with my support for the 300M/250M NCL. Although the 200M ADA does not meet all budget proposals, it forces prioritization of high-impact projects, consistent with my vote for 350M to promote disciplined growth. The lower limit reduces selling pressure on ADA, addresses Stake Pool Operators’ concerns after their rejection of the 350M NCL, and supports price stability. By voting YES, I break the deadlock following the split over the 350M NCL, enabling treasury withdrawals before the May 30, 2025, deadline."

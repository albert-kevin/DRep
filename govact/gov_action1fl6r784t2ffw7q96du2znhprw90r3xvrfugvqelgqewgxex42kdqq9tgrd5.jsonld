    "comment": "I’m voting NO. SNEK has real momentum and has already paid for big listings itself, but using 5M ADA from the Cardano Treasury to list and market one token isn’t a public-good expense. It sets a precedent for project-specific listing fees, shifts focus off on-chain growth (CEX trading doesn’t require the Cardano network), and diverts funds from things that help everyone—developer tools, ADA/stablecoin liquidity, compliance frameworks any token can reuse, UX, and core upgrades. We’ll get better long-term onboarding from ecosystem work like BOS, Midnight, and later Leios—tech alone isn’t enough, but public money should build foundations, not promote a single ticker. For marketing-style asks, Project Catalyst is the better venue where the whole community (not just DReps) reviews and votes.\n\nSide note for newcomers: if you enjoy the culture, check out Snek and its playful cousin Snok, plus NikePig—they’re part of Cardano’s meme “family” and fun to follow. \n(snek.com) (snok.lol) (nikepig.com)"
